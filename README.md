# Q-Tacotron
Q-Tacotron implementation using Google's TPGST

This is the q-tacotron implementation based on [this article](https://habr.com/ru/company/sberdevices/blog/548812/). <br>
For now I plan on making it russian language only, bilinguality coming later. <br>
Best to use inside https://github.com/neonsecret/TTS-With-Voice-Cloning-Multilang
